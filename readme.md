# Velha/21 Server

A server for the games tic-tac-toe and Blackjack in Node.js.

The blackjack variant we are going to implement follows the rules in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyoh-Ku9TCI), but assuming all
players placed the same bet. Those who leave the table with more than they
started are considered winners, and the others losers.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Start server
```bash
npm run startd
```

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
